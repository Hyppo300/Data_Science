# SQL
Database: Any collection of related information
Database Management System: Software program that helps users create and maintain a database (provide security, management, import/export, interaction with 
other applications)
**CRUD:** CREATE-READ-UPDATE-DELETE
**Relational SQL:** Organize data in one or more tables. Tables are rows and columns with key identifiers. Example: PostgreSQL, Oracle etc
**Non-Relational SQL:** Stores in set of key-values. Has graphs and flexible tables. Example: MongoDB, firebase, Apache Cassandra etc.
## **Structured Query Language:** Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS. Used to perform CRUD operations and administration tasks. Used to define tables 
and structures. SQL code is not always portable.
Non-Relational DBMS have their own language for implementing CRUD operations.
**Query** is set of instructions to tell DBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
Relational Database has the following important features:
- Primary key: Uniquely identifies each row/record
- Surrogate key: Same as primary key but mapping is unavailable.
- Natural Key: Primary key but has mapping in real-world scenarios for example consider security number a primary key is also a natural key.
- Foreign key; Primary key that links us to another table.
- Composite key: Is a primary key but needs 2 attributes.
## Parts of SQL:
**DQL**: Data Query Language used to query database for information already stored.
**DDL**: Data Definition Language used for defining database schemas
**DCL**: Data Control Language controls access to data (users/permissions)
**DML**: Data Management Language (insert, update, delete)
