***# What is Data Science?***
Data science is a combination of mathematics and computer science field. Data scientist’s role is to analyze the data and find useful insights from it which 
can be used to improve business. 
Data scientists works between IT companies and businesses in a way that they provide IT based solution for business enhancements using data.
For example, Netflix suggestion are all according to user’s interests. How do they know that? They gather user’s data, analyze it, and find frequent similar 
patterns and suggest the movie which highly matches the observed pattern. Many other businesses like finding best route for your ride, elections winning 
prediction and many more apply data science. 

## Data Science & Business Analytics:
Data science scientifically deals with unstructured data focused on present and future. Major skills include mathematics, statistics, visualization, 
machine learning etc.
Whereas business analytics analytically deals with structured data focused on past and present. Skills include statistics, visualization etc.

## Pre-requisites for becoming Data scientist:
Data science is a huge field as it is combo of two entire fields i.e., IT and business. For a good start in data science, you should be familiar with 
statistics, ,mathematics, machine learning, computer programming and databases. A basic knowledge of all these domains is a must for data science. 
There are various tools and skills used in data science. For instance, when doing data analysis, you need to know programming languages like python or 
R and development environments like Jupyter, MATLAB or R studio etc. For data visualization you have cognos, Tableau and same programming languages stack. 
For data warehousing, you deal data bases things more specifically, so you got to know tools like informatica, AWS Redshift etc. For machine learning, 
you need to know ML algorithms and tools like Azure ML studio, Mahout etc.

## Role of a data scientist:
Data scientists start by first selecting data sets (raw form) and then converting them so that algorithm can e applied and then find useful patterns and 
insights from data. Uses those outcomes to form rules and then predicts on basis of those set of rules.

## Data science lifecycle:
1.	Concept study – Study use case, your targets, given data and all related useful information. 
2.	Data preparation - Make the data clean and valuable, remove missing and redundant values.
3.	Model planning - Run exploratory data analysis and find out best model for your data. Divide into test (for validating model) and train (for developing 
  	model) sets.
4.	Model building – After selection, model is deployed and prediction are outcomes which are then validated for best accuracy. 
5.	Communication – Data scientist should communicate his findings with business team.
6.	Operationalize – Final reports, documents delivered by the team.

## Demand for data scientist: 
Data scientists are in high demand because companies are using their data to enhance their business and stay step ahead of their competition. 
Data scientists are required in every field. 
 
## Data Science (Past-Present-Future)
{Business x Data: Preliminary data reports, qualitative analysis, sales forecasting, reporting with visuals, creating dashboards} -> Past
{Business Analytics: Sales forecasting
Data : Data analysis
Data science: optimization of drilling operations
Business intelligence: Reporting with Visuals, Creating Dashboards
Machine learning (data analytics) x business analytics: Client Retention, Fraud Prevention
Business Intelligence X machine learning: creating real time dashboards
Data science X ML: Speech Recognition, Image Recognition
AI: Data analytics + data science + business analytics + business intelligence} -> Present & Future

# Probability:
-	It is measure of likelihood of an event.
-	Example: Tossing a coin and picking card from a deck
-	Probability = No of times an event has occurred/No of possible outcomes. P(H) = ½ for tossing a coin, P(1) when rolling a dice = 1/6
-	Mutual Exclusive : Tossing a coin (H or T { H and T never}   P(H or T)= 1)
-	Not mutual exclusive : Picking card from deck (K and heart can occur in one outcome) - P(K OR HEART)= P(K) + P(HEART) -P(K^HEART)=16/52
-	Addition : ME : P (A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
-	NME : P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) -P(A^B) 
-	Multiplicative rule : Independent and dependent events
-	Independent : Probability of one is not affected by other. No of outcomes will not reduce. Example: tossing a coin.
-	Dependent: Probability of  one is affected by other. No of outcomes will reduce. Example: Taking card from deck without replacement.
-	Independent : P(A or B)= P(A) * p(B/A)->conditional probability
-	Dependent : P(A or B) = P(A) * P(B)

# Combinatorics:
[Reference](https://medium.com/@kirk.borne/data-science-meets-combinatorics-29738280342e)

Combinatorics is the mathematics of counting and arranging. Combinatorics is often concerned with how things are arranged. In this context, an arrangement 
is a way objects could be grouped. The most basic rules regarding arrangements are the rule of product and the rule of sum. These rules govern how to count 
arrangements using the operations of multiplication and addition, respectively.
Example: A fair coin is tossed twice. Write down the set of possible outcomes. What is the probability of obtaining?
1. Exactly one head
2. No head

Answer: p1 =  0.5, p2 =  0.25

# Python Basics: 
-	Hello world: To print hello world in python, write print followed by () and print you required data.
-	Variables and types: Python does not need you to specify data types for variables.
-	Deals with only float and integers numbers {integer a=7 and float a=7.0}
-	Strings defined with single or double strings.
-	More than one variable can be defined in one statement.
-	Lists: List is similar to array, can store any type of variable and can be iterated easily. {syntax: alist=[]}
-	There are many built-in methods for working with lists. Some of them are append(for adding items to end of list), count(Count number of elements), 
remove(remove element with specified value), sort(arrange in order/sorting), clear(removes all elements of list).
