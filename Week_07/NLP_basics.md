# Natural Language Processing:
Humans communicate with each other in natural language which can be mixture of some languages. They understand each other because of this language. By using 
Natural Language Processing, we want to enable a computer to understand the language as humans do and respond in the same way. 
Applications of NLP:
- Speech Recognition ( Identifies language by interpreting speech and acting in appropriate way e.g., Google assistant, Apple’s Siri)
- Sentiment Analysis ( Rating or describing a view/opinion e.g., review is positive or negative)
- Machine Translation (Translating text/speech from one language to another)
- Chatbots ( Human vs Machine conversation using machine’s data)

## Natural Language Understanding:
Understanding what users wants to say, what is user’s intention and meaning. This is quite challenging and is very ambiguous task.
Some of challenges we can face while performing natural language understanding are lexical ambiguity (tokenization leads to multiple meanings of one word and 
answer should consider the context of question), syntactic ambiguity(structure of sentence should be valid), semantic ambiguity (meaning should be clear e.g., 
car hit the pole while it was moving) and pragmatic ambiguity (context of phrase give multiple interpretations).

## Natural Language Generation:
After understanding user’s statement, your answer should be in accordance with the requirements. It should be intelligent and conversational. Deals with 
structural data, divides them into small corpus and plans the output using text and sentence relation.
